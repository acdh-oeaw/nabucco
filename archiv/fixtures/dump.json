Data have been provided, in addition to the persons mentioned above, by Stefania Ermidoro, Melanie Gross, Evelien Vanderstraeten, Matthias Adelhofer and others, and over the years NABUCCO has benefited significantly from the input, intellectual and technical, of Shai Gordin. The creation of the site in its present form and location, hosted by the Austrian Academy of Science's ACDH, was largely the work of Reinhard Pirngruber. Funding has come, in different phases, from the KU Leuven, the Belgian Science Policy Office (Project PVII/14), the University of Vienna, and the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, Vienna; most recently project I 3927).</p>",

By linking topographic points and zones with functionaries and their activities, the study will attempt to delineate the levels of access within Eanna and areas in which guards, oblates, and priests operated.

In addition, there are thousands of tablets and (predominantly) fragments found by the German excavations. The archive contains some material from the time of the Assyrian domination, but dense information is only available from the beginning of the reign of Nabopolassar. There is a clear break in the second year of Darius, possibly connected to the investigations into the affairs of the corrupt temple slave Gimillu; only comparatively few later texts are known. The latest texts dates to 29 Dar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The high percentage of contracts found in the Eanna archive (vis-&agrave;-vis Ebabbar/Sippar), at least in the collections, originating from illicit excavations, is striking. What this means for the structure of the archive remains to be investigated. Another clear distinction is the fact that only few and comparatively small private archives could be identified in the material originating from the clandestine excavations.</p>",

            "description": "<p>This is the largest private archive from first millennium Babylonia spanning five generations with ca. 1,700 identified tablets and reports (by illicit excavators) speak of well above 2,000 texts. The majority of the tablets is in the British museum, in the 1876-11-17 collection and others; comparatively smaller groups are in the Louvre, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Metropolitan Museum, J.P. Morgan Library, Ashmolean Museum, Pitt Rivers Museum, Royal Scottisch Museum, Museo di Storia ed Arte, Finnisches Nationalmuseum, Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery, Universit&auml;tsbibliothek Giessen, Oriental Institute Chicago, Fitzwilliam Museum, University of British Columbia, Mus&eacute;es Royaux, J.F. Lewis Collection, Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin, Harvard Semitic Museum, Princeton Theological Seminary, Free Library of Philadelphia, and private collections. The main protagonists are all offspring of a single male line: &Scaron;ul\u0101ya/Nab&ucirc;-z\u0113ru-uk\u012bn/Egibi&nbsp;(20 Npl&shy;-23 Nbk), Nab&ucirc;-ahh\u0113-iddin/&Scaron;ul\u0101ya&nbsp;(15 Nbk-&shy;12 Nbn), Itti-Marduk-bal\u0101\u1e6du (= Iddin\u0101ya)/Nab&ucirc;-ahh\u0113-iddin&nbsp;(5 Nbn&shy;-8 Cam), Marduk-n\u0101\u1e63ir-apli (= &Scaron;irku)/Itti-Marduk-bal\u0101\u1e6du&nbsp;(1-&shy;35 Dar) and finally his son Nidinti-B\u0113l&nbsp;(32 Dar&shy;-0 &Scaron;ama&scaron;-er\u012bba). Itti-Marduk-bal\u0101\u1e6du was married to fN\u016bpt\u0101ya, the daughter of Iddin-Marduk/Iq\u012b&scaron;\u0101ya/N\u016br-S&icirc;n&nbsp;(28 Nbk-&shy;2 Dar) and fIna-Esagila-ram&acirc;t/Z\u0113ria/Nab\u0101ya&nbsp;(34 Nbk&shy;15 Dar), which brought about the transfer of parts of the N\u016br-S&icirc;n archive; the core of which has not been found. The Egibi archive contains numerous family and property documents, including title deeds, except for the last phase which reinforces it identification as a &ldquo;dead&rdquo; archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a steady increase in the dowries family members received from their wives and gave to their own daughters over the generations, highlighting the family&rsquo;s economic development from a modest trade in agricultural products, financed through <em>harr\u0101nu </em>ventures, to large-scale agricultural undertakings involving the family estates and rented (institutional) land through slave-agents. It seems that Itti-Marduk-bal\u0101\u1e6du also took over some of Iddin-Marduk&rsquo;s business. The family&rsquo;s patrimony was continuously enlarged through the purchase of (often small) fields (usually turned into date gardens) and plots of urban land. Nab&ucirc;-ahh\u0113-iddin was the first to have obvious institutional connections: business with the royal family and role as royal judge. This led to an increasing involvement in various forms of tax farming under the first Achaemenid rulers.&nbsp;The absence of temple prebends ownership identifies the Egibis as entrepreneurially oriented urbanites without well-established roots in the traditional temple-oriented establishment.</p>",
