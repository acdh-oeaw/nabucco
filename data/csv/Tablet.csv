2) The second area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) measures 0;0.5.5 Kor (2625 m<sup>2</sup>) in total. Its upper side in the West, 300 cubits (150 m) long, borders on a plot of 0.0.0.5.6 2/3 Kor (425 m<sup>2</sup>) with x cubits long short sides, and on the property of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong>, mother of <strong>D<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>; its lower side in the East, which has the same length as the upper side borders on the property of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> und <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>.

4) The fourth measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>), of an unknown size, has the same lengths and neighbours for the long sides: 300 cubits (150 m), <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> in the West, and <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> in the East. Its upper front side in the North is 20 2/3 cubits (c. 10,3 m) long and borders on the previous (third) measured area, while its lower front in the South, 16 1/2 cubits (c. 8,25 m) long, borders on the measured area (<em>libbū eqli</em>). LINE<br />
5) The surface area of the fifth plot (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>) is also lost in a lacuna. Its long sides are 300 cubits (150 m) long and border on the property of <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> in the West and on the land of <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> in the East. The upper front in the North, 16 1/2 cubits (c. 8,25 m) long, is adjacent to the previous (fourth) plot in the North; its lower front side in the South is 10 cubits (5 m) long and borders on the next plot (<em>libbū eqli</em>).

6) The sixth measured area (<em>mi&scaron;ihtu</em>), whose size is lost in a lacuna, has once again the same lengths and neighbours for its long sides: 300 cubits (150 m), <strong><sup>f</sup>C</strong> in the West, and <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> in the East. Its upper front side in the North is 10 cubits (5 m) long and is adjacent to the previous (fifth) measured area, while the lower front side in the South borders on the next plot. LINE<br />

The present document provide details on how the three Egibi brothers, <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> divide amongst them their father&rsquo;s property. It concerns the allocation of shares in houses, slaves, arable land, animals, outstanding debts, business assests and varia.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, the eldest brother, takes as his half share (<em>ahi zitti</em>) 10 houses and more than 40 slaves. He also receives 6 minas of silver, paid to him as equalizing payment (<em>takpurtu</em>) for property in Borsippa. First, the property in Babylon is detailed: 7 houses, one of which is no more than a reed building (<em>huṣṣu</em>) and a plot of unbuilt land (<em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>).Then, information about the property in Borsippa follow: this consists of 3 houses and 3;0.3 &frac12; sq. r (c. 42.87 m<sup>2</sup>) of built/building land (<em>bītu</em>). Finally, there is a detailed list of the slaves.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The other half share (<em>ahi zitti</em>) in houses and slaves goes to <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>, and consists of 6 houses (resp. building land), 4 of which are in Babylon and 2 in Borsippa, and 51 slaves (<em>amīlūtu</em>). Thus, <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> receive: (1) the family&rsquo;s main house (lit. &ldquo;the big house of Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin&rdquo;) in Babylon, (2) including the land (<em>qan&ucirc;</em>) with the houses, some of them dilapidated, that goes with it; (3) another house in Babylon, (4) a 2 sq. r (c. 24,50 m<sup>2</sup>) building plot (<em>qan&ucirc;</em>) in the Te-neighbourhood of Babylon; (5) a house in Borsippa, (6) and the big, old house in Borsippa. <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> give to their older brother 6 minas of silver as equalizing payment (<em>takpurtu</em>) to buy it out: such sum compensates (<em>apālu</em>) for his larger share in the main house (<em>ultu bītu rab&ucirc;</em>) in Borsippa, and <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> confirms that he has taken (<em>leq&ucirc;</em>) this silver.<br />
<br />
The houses listed above are all identified by their bordering properties and in some cases also by the person from whom it was bought. The slaves are listed by name and usually grouped in families (Slave X, his wife Y, (and) Z<sub>, </sub>their child(ren)/daughter).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Next comes the division (<em>itti ahāme&scaron;</em> <em>izuzzu</em>) of arable land, animals and future income. One half share belongs to <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, the other to <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>. It concerns shares in their land cultivated with trees and grain (<em>zēru zaqpu u mēre&scaron;u</em>), as much as there is, including also any arable land (<em>zēru</em>) that <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> bought in his name, or in his wife&rsquo;s (<strong><sup>f</sup>B</strong>) name or through a proxy. The brothers also divide their <em>oxen</em>, small livestock (<em>ṣēnu</em>) and donkeys, their income from <em>nishu</em>-payments that have still not been paid off (<em>ina sūqu</em>), their escaped slaves and all their other goods (<em>mimma mala ba&scaron;&ucirc;</em>, lit. &ldquo;whatever there is&rdquo;).<br />
<br />
Finally, there are a series of cases that need special attention. First comes (the slave) <strong>C, </strong>his wife and children, his house and his entire property (be it inside or outside his land, lit. &ldquo;in the house or on the street&rdquo;): it is agreed that <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> will divide it into shares (<em>ahi zitti</em>) and each will take his share<strong>. </strong>Secondly, it is stated that <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> have paid off (<em>eṭēru</em>) their share (<em>zittu</em>) in the debt (<em>ra&scaron;&ucirc;tu</em>) owed by <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>. Thirdly, the older brother and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> are allowed to take (<em>leq&ucirc;</em>) the properties that were part of their wives&rsquo; dowries (<em>nudunn&ucirc;</em>). Fourthly, the three brothers take whatever property that they made available to <strong>D</strong> to do business with (<em>harranu</em>), including a house in Hursagkalamma, and divide it into 2 equal shares (<em>ahi zitti</em>). The 0;1 sq. kor (c. 2700 m<sup>2</sup>) of land planted with trees (<em>zēru zaqpu</em>), located outside (<em>kīd&acirc;nu</em>) the Zababa Gate, is evenly shared (<em>malmali&scaron; zittu</em>) by <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Through their commonly held property (<em>kar&ucirc;</em>), they will clear (<em>murruqu</em>) any possible claim (<em>paqāru</em>) about this division, and [...] to each other (<em>ana ahāme&scaron;</em>).

The text begins providing details for these preceding deals, starting with six plots of land situated in &Scaron;uppatu, in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon:<br />
1) <strong>C</strong> bought 1;4.3.3 Kor (25875 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) for 2 minas and 3 shekels of silver, inclusive of the additional payment (<em>adi</em> <em>atri</em>), from <strong>D</strong> (C <em>ina qātē </em>D &hellip; <em>mahīra epe&scaron;u</em>). It consists parly of a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>) and partly of cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>). Within this total area, 0;2.0.3 Kor (5625 m<sup>2</sup>) corresponds to the surface of the land cultivated with dates, whose value (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) corresponds to 1 mina and 15 shekels of silver; 1;2.3 Kor (20250 m<sup>2</sup>) is the surface of the cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>), whose value (<em>&scaron;uqultu</em>) corresponds to 45 shekels of silver.<br />
2) <strong>C</strong> also bought 1;1.4 Kor (18000 m<sup>2</sup>) of cultivated land (<em>zēru mēre&scaron;u</em>), of which 1 Kor (13500 m<sup>2</sup>) is of lower quality (<em>kal&ucirc; u gabību</em>), for 37 1/4 shekels of silver from <strong>E</strong> (A <em>ina qātē </em>C &hellip; <em>mahīra epe&scaron;u</em>).<br />
3) <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>4</sub></strong> bought a plot of land, whose surface details are lost in a lacuna, for 43 1/3 shekels of silver from [<strong>E?</strong>] (<sup>f</sup>D <em>ina qātē </em>[PN] &hellip; <em>mahīra epe&scaron;u</em>). This plot is located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) and it is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>).<br />
4) The same woman bought for the same amount of silver another plot of land whose area is unknown, from a seller whose name is also lost. The land is located in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>): it is a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>).<br />
5) <strong>C</strong> also bought 0;3.2 Kor (6300 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>) for 1 mina of silver, from <strong>F</strong> (A <em>ina qātē </em>E &hellip; <em>mahīra epe&scaron;u</em>). This area includes a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>) as well as cultivated land (<em>mēre&scaron;u</em>).<br />
6) The description of the last plot of agricultural land is lost in a lacuna, only the term wasteland (<em>ki&scaron;ubb&ucirc;</em>) can be read with certainty.<br />
Then, the text records the purchase of 2 more areas (<em>erṣetu</em>):<br />
7) Details for the first one cannot be read because of a gap in the tablet: from what is left, we know that <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>4</sub></strong> bought this land from someone (whose name is lost) for [x]+2/3 minas of silver.<br />
8) <strong>G</strong> bought an area of 6 sq. r (73,50 m<sup>2</sup>) in Tē, inside the city of Babylon, for 2 minas and 4 shekels of silver from <strong>H<sub>1</sub></strong> and his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>H<sub>2</sub></strong> (G <em>ina qātē </em>H<sub>1</sub> <em>u</em> <sup>f</sup>H<sub>2</sub> &hellip; <em>mahīra epe&scaron;u</em>).<br />
Finally, the purchase of the three slaves <strong>I<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>I<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>I<sub>3</sub></strong> is mentioned: their price (<em>mahīrāti&scaron;unu</em>) amounts to 5 minas of silver.<br />
Then, the tablet provides the totals: 4;3.5.3 kor (64575 m<sup>2</sup>) of cultivated land sold for 5 minas and 49 shekels of silver &ndash; inclusive of the additional payment (<em>adi</em> <em>atri</em>); 27;5.6 sq. r (371,85 m<sup>2</sup>) of land sold for 13 minas and 48 1/2 shekels of silver &ndash; inclusive of the additional payment and of the clothing (<em>adi</em> <em>atri u lubāri</em>); three slaves <strong>I<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>I<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>I<sub>3</sub></strong>, sold for 5 minas of silver.<br />
Now,<strong> A </strong>purchases all these properties for 24 minas and 37 shekels of silver, i.e. their full price (<em>&scaron;īmī&scaron;u</em><sup>!</sup> <em>gamrūtu</em>), from <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong> (uncle of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>), <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> (grandmother of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>) and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>4</sub></strong> (mother of <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> and wife of <strong>C</strong>). The sellers confirm that they have received (<em>mahāru</em>) the whole amount of silver which was due for their fields, houses and slaves, and they are satisfied (<em>aplū</em>) All the parties agree that in future times there will be no claims or suits against each other, not even between members of their families &ndash; otherwise, any future claimant (<em>pāqirānu</em>) will have to repay twelvefold the silver he received.<br />
The income of these business deals are then transferred to <strong>L<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>L<sub>2</sub></strong>, the creditors (<em>rā&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) of <strong>C</strong> (<strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s father), <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>4</sub></strong>: they take out 20 minas and 17 shekels from the total amount of silver, as payment for their credit (<em>ina ra&scaron;&ucirc;ti&scaron;unu</em>). <strong>M<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>M<sub>2</sub></strong>, who previously took a house as pledge (<em>ma&scaron;kanu ṣabātu</em>) and have lived inside it since then, take the remaining silver: 4 minas and 20 shekels.<br />
Finally, the text states that the fingernails (<em>ṣupru</em>) of the sellers <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>4</sub></strong> are impressed on the tablet instead of their seal impressions (<em>kunukku</em>).

Its upper side in the North measures 720 cubits (360 m) and borders on <strong>C</strong>&rsquo;s land; its lower side in the South has the same length and borders on <strong>D</strong>&rsquo;s land.

The buyer has declared the equivalent of the field (<em>mahīra nab&ucirc;</em>) to be 1 mina of silver and has given to <strong>B</strong>, the seller, the total price (<em>&scaron;īmi&scaron;u gamrūtu</em>) plus 3 shekels of silver as additional payment (<em>&scaron;a k&icirc; p&icirc; atri</em>). In total, <strong>B </strong>receives (<em>mahāru</em>) 1 mina and 3 shekels of silver from <strong>A</strong> as purchase price of his field (<em>eqlu</em>).

The tablet records the purchase of agricultural land which, given its irregular shape, is calculated according to two measured areas: each one of these plots is described separately, marked on the tablet by a line drawn at the end of each paragraph (and indicated below in the paraphrase by LINE).<br />
<strong>A</strong> purchases&nbsp; 0;1 Kor (2700 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) from three members of the same family: <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>, his sister <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> and his brother-in-law <strong>B<sub>3</sub></strong>.

LINE<br />
The first portion (<em>mi&scaron;īhtu</em>) measures 457 cubits (228,5 m), its upper side in the North borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>, its lower side in the South measures 450 cubits (225 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>, the buyer. Its upper front in the West measures 22 1/2 cubits (11,25 m) and borders on (the property of) <strong>D</strong>, its lower front in the East measures 21 cubits (10,5 m) and is adjacent to the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>). In total, the area of the first measured area (<em>mi&scaron;īhtu</em>) above the royal street (<em>elān harrān &scaron;arri</em>) is 0;0.5.2.7 Kor (2452,5 m<sup>2</sup>). LINE<br />
The second plot has a more regular surface: its long sides both measure 57 1/2 cubits (28,75 m) &ndash; the one in the North borders on (the property of) <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> and the one in the South on (the property of) <strong>A</strong>; its upper front in the West is 21 1/2 cubits (10,75 m) long and borders on the royal street (<em>harrān &scaron;arri</em>) and the lower front in the East is adjacent to the marshes (<em>raqqatu</em>) on the bank of the Euphrates (<em>ki&scaron;ād nār Puratti</em>).

The text begins by recalling a business deal that took place in &Scaron;abāṭ (XI) of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s 30<sup>th</sup> year, when <strong>A</strong> &ndash; governor of Babylon (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēm Bābili</em>) &ndash; purchased 23;2.3 Kor (137250 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>) from <strong>B</strong>, through his proxy <strong>C </strong>(<em>ina na&scaron;partu</em>). It was a field in the open country (<em>eqel ṣēri</em>), consisting partly of a cultivated date garden (<em>kir&ucirc; gi&scaron;immarē zaqpi</em>) bearing fruit (<em>iṣṣi bilti</em>), and partly of cultivated as well as newly cleared land (<em>eqlu mēre&scaron;u u tapt&ucirc;</em>); the land was located above and below the New Canal, in front of the Enlil Gate in the district (<em>pīhatu</em>) of Babylon.<br />
<strong>A </strong>payed 19 minas and 30 shekels of silver for this land; at the moment of the purchase, he sealed (<em>kanāku</em>) a document in which it was stated that if the field would have been found smaller or larger than what was originally calculated, the parties would satisfy each other&rsquo;s claims (<em>ahāme&scaron; apālu </em>) in accordance with its price (<em>k&icirc; mahīri</em>). However, they never came nor measured the field.<br />
The second half of the tablet, that records the new purchase and the consequences of the revision of the previous deal, is unfortunately severely damaged. One reads that, according to the king&rsquo;s instruction, <strong>A</strong>, in his role of governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmūti</em>) of the inhabitants of Babylon (<em>mārē Bābili</em>), had [...] and promised to the inhabitants of Babylon to give it (the field?) back [...].<br />
Fifteen years after the first purchase, in the accession year of the king Neriglissar, <strong>D</strong> acquires (<em>mahāru</em>) this field (<em>eqlu &scaron;uati</em>), 23;2.3 Kor (137250 m<sup>2</sup>) of agricultural land (<em>zēru</em>), from <strong>A</strong>&rsquo;s four sons <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>E<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>E<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>E<sub>4</sub></strong>. He pays 22 minas and 20 shekels of silver, and confirms that <strong>F</strong> owns a half share (<em>ahi zitti &scaron;a </em>F <em>&scaron;akānu</em>).<br />
The rest of the tablet is too broken to allow a correct reconstruction of its contents: from what can still be read in the final clauses one infers that the full price has been received (<em>eṭēru</em>) and that there will be no opportunity to come back to the issue. &nbsp;Names of 6 witnesses and 2 scribes.<br />

A large part of this fragmentarily preserved document consists of declarations in direct speech in which the role of <strong>C</strong>, witness to a property transfer, is discussed. In the opening lines, in fact, <strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> declares under oath (<em>nī&scaron; zakāru</em>) before the judges (<em>dayyānu</em>) that he does not know (<em>id&ucirc;)</em><strong> C,</strong> the third witness listed in the tablet (<em>ṭuppu</em>) that records the transfer of assets (<em>nikkassu</em>) to <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>. The name of the donor is lost in a lacuna, but can safely be reconstructed as <strong>B</strong>, and if we assume that <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong> the beneficiary, was his wife, we are dealing with a property transfer between husband and wife. Then<strong> A</strong><sub>2 </sub>testifies (verb is broken off) before <strong>D</strong>, the governor (<em>&scaron;ākin ṭēmi</em>) of Babylon that when <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong> (the donor) fell ill, he sent <strong>E</strong> to someone (possibly <strong>C</strong>), asking him to come over. He (possibly <strong>C) </strong>eventually went to <strong>B<sub>1</sub> </strong>(<em>ana pāni alāku</em>) and they decided not to bring suit against <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> (<em>itti dabābu</em>). The following fragmentary passage mentions <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s arable land (<em>zēru</em>) and building plots (<em>qan&ucirc;</em>), and again states that &quot;they did not bring suit&quot;. It seems that a dispute had arisen about some of the assets that <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>had transferred to <strong><sup>f</sup>B<sub>2</sub></strong>, but that it eventually did not lead to a formal lawsuit. In the final lines, mostly lost, the role of <strong>C</strong> is brought up again in directly quoted testimonies by persons whose identity cannot be established. It is claimed that he could strictly speaking not act as witness (<em>&scaron;ībū</em>), considering the fact that he is a slave (<em>qallu </em>&scaron;ū). Someone apparently allowed him to be listed (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) among the witnesses since they were both present (<em>amāru</em>, lit. &quot;to see&quot;) when the purchase price was paid (<em>mahīru nad&acirc;nu)</em>. Finally, in a direct speech someone states that although <strong>B<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s tablet has been changed (<em>en&ucirc;</em>), he/she remembers (<em>hasāsu</em>) to whom it had been given.

Concerns <strong>A&#39;s </strong>legal efforts to take possession of four slaves as compensation for having repaid a debt on behalf of <strong>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>&nbsp;and his wife. In Nabonidus&rsquo; 8<sup>th</sup> regnal year, <strong>B</strong> raised a claim against <strong>C<sub>1</sub> </strong>(concerning) 2 1/3 minas of silver, and issued a promissory note against him and his wife <strong><sup>f</sup>C<sub>2</sub></strong>. He took their children <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong><sup>f</sup>D<sub>3</sub></strong> and <strong>D<sub>4</sub></strong>, their house and every property they held inside and outside the city as a pledge.

Now, <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> did not pay; he and his wife died &ndash; after which <strong>B</strong> brought <strong>A</strong> in front of Nabonidus&#39; judges who looked into the written legal evidence (<em>riksu</em>). They entitled (<em>ra</em><em>&scaron;&ucirc; </em>&Scaron;) <strong>A</strong> to those 2 1/3 minas of silver, apart from the silver that he had previously given to the creditor. &nbsp;<strong>A</strong> paid the silver to <strong>B</strong>, he has given <strong>A</strong> the promissory note as well as a copy (<em>gabr</em><em>&ucirc;</em>) of the process protocol (<em>ṭ</em><em>uppi d</em><em>īni</em>). The judges referred <strong>A</strong> back (<em>nah</em><em>ā</em><em>su </em>&Scaron;) to <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s house to recup his silver from the inheritance. <strong>A</strong> then brought <strong>E<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong>&rsquo;s heir (<em>iar</em><em>ī</em><em>tu</em>) and <strong><sup>f</sup>E<sub>2</sub></strong>, his sister-in-law, before the judges.

The plaintiffs are <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and her adopted son <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong>; the defendant is her husband&#39;s brother <strong>B</strong>. The case primarily concerns her rights to a house that she and her husband bought with her dowry silver.<br />
The court protocol opens with a quotation of <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s statement before the judges of Nabonidus. She recounts that she is married to <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>, brought 3 1/2 minas of silver as her dowry (<em>nudunn&ucirc;</em>) into the marriage, and bore him a daughter <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>D</strong>. Together they bought a built house (<em>bītu ep&scaron;u</em>), 8 reeds (c. 90 m<sup>2</sup>) large, in the district (<em>er</em><em>ṣ</em><em>etu</em>) called &ldquo;Small region on the other bank&rdquo; (<em>ahullā qalla</em>) in Borsippa, for 9 minas and 20 shekels of silver. The purchase was financed a.o. with her dowry silver and with a loan (<em>ana nishi na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) of 2 minas and 30 shekels of silver from C (cf. BM30506 = Nbn 187). In Nabonidus&rsquo; 4<sup>th</sup> regnal year, she argued with her husband (<em>itti ragāmu</em>) about (<em>a&scaron;&scaron;u</em>) her dowry and he, with full consent (<em>ina migir libbi&scaron;u</em>), gave her under seal (<em>kanāku</em> - <em>dagālu </em>&Scaron;) that built house in Borsippa, forever (<em>ana ūmī ṣ&acirc;ti</em>). In the donation document, he stated that they agreed to pay off together (<em>itti ahame&scaron; eṭēru</em>) the 2 1/2 minas of silver that they borrowed (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) from <strong>B</strong> for the purchase of that house. <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong> wrote down (<em>&scaron;a</em><em>ṭ</em><em>āru</em>) the oath that he pronounced by the great gods in the document and sealed it. In Nabonidus&rsquo; 5<sup>th</sup> regnal year, she and her husband adopted <strong>C</strong> as son (<em>ana mārūti leq&ucirc;</em>), and they wrote (<em>&scaron;aṭāru</em>) an adoption tablet (<em>ṭuppi mārūti</em>) for him. At that time they also made known (<em>id&ucirc; </em>&Scaron;) the content of their daughter&#39;s dowry (<strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>D</strong>): 2 minas and 10 shekels of silver and household goods (<em>ud&ecirc; bīti</em>). Now, after <strong>A</strong><sub>3</sub>&rsquo;s death, <strong>B</strong>, his brother (= <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong>&#39;s in-law, <em>em&ucirc;</em>) has raised a claim (<em>paqāri ba&scaron;&ucirc; </em>&Scaron;) on the house and on everything else that his brother gave to <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> in a sealed document (<em>kanāku &ndash; dagālu &Scaron;</em>), as well as on a slave, <strong>E</strong>, whom the couple bought (<em>ana kaspi abāku</em>) from <strong>F</strong>. <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> concludes her statement by saying: I have brought (<em>abālu</em>) him in front of you: establish our decision (<em>puruss&ucirc; &scaron;akānu</em>)!&rdquo;.<br />
The second part of the tablet records the judges&rsquo; actions and verdict. They hear the parties&rsquo; arguments (<em>dibbu</em> <em>&scaron;em&ucirc;</em>), review (<em>&scaron;as&ucirc;</em>) the tablets (<em>ṭuppu)</em> and contracts (<em>riksu</em>) that <strong><sup>f</sup></strong><strong>A<sub>1</sub></strong> brought as evidence, and deliberate (<em>mitluku</em>). They deny <strong>B</strong>&rsquo;s claims (<em>la ra&scaron;&ucirc;</em> &Scaron;) on the house in Borsippa, which had been given to <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong> instead of her dowry (<em>kūm nudunn&ecirc;</em>), the slave <strong>E</strong> whom she bought (<em>ana kaspi &scaron;&acirc;mu</em>) together with her husband and everything else that belonged to <strong>A<sub>3</sub></strong>. The judges establish the legal rights of&nbsp; <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>A<sub>2</sub></strong> on the basis of their written evidence (<em>ina ṭuppi uzuzzu</em>). <strong>B</strong> will have priority (<em>pen&ucirc;</em>) in recovering (<em>&scaron;alāmu</em> G) the silver, 2 1/2 minas, which was used to pay for the house; then, <strong><sup>f</sup>A<sub>1</sub></strong> will recover&nbsp; the 3 1/2 minas of silver from her dowry; finally, <strong><sup>f</sup>D</strong> will get <strong>E</strong> as her inheritance share (<em>zittu</em>), as established in her father&rsquo;s contracts (<em>riksu</em>).

It opens with <strong>A</strong>&#39;s declaration (<em>qab&ucirc; umma</em>) that the Treasurer&#39;s mayordomo wanted the products to be registered in his accounts (<em>ina muhhi-ya u&scaron;uzzu</em>) saying that he gave them to <strong>C<sub>1 </sub></strong>and <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong>: they received from him the 170 kor of barley (<em>in-da-har-in-ni</em> [<em>mahāru</em>]), whereas only <strong>C<sub>2</sub></strong> (<em>ana elat ana </em>PN) was given the 4 kor of wheat and 4 kor of cress (<em>at-ta-din</em> [<em>nadānu</em>]). This is confirmed (<em>kan&ucirc;</em> D) by the two men in their own testimony (<em>eli ramāni-&scaron;unu</em>)<em> </em>as follows (<em>umma</em>): they both took (<em>na&scaron;&ucirc;</em>) the barley from <strong>B</strong>, and only <strong>C<sub>1</sub></strong> received (<em>mahāru</em>) the wheat and cress from <strong>B</strong>.

<strong>A</strong> receives (<em>mahāru</em>) 1/3 minas of marked silver from <strong>B</strong>. The background to this payment is a labour agreement between both parties according to which <strong>A</strong> will work for <strong>B</strong> (<em>ina pāni PN uzuzzu</em>) at a yearly salary (<em>idū</em>)<em> </em>of 1/3 minas of marked silver, starting on the 1<sup>st</sup> of &Scaron;abaṭ (XI).
